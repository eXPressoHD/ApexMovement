# ApexMovement
FPS Prototype with similar movement as in Apex Legends. You can shoot enemies (weapon has recoil), crouch, wallrun and climb ladders. All implemented in a custom C# PlayerMovement class.
There are two types of enemies: Snipers and normal Enemies which follow the player if in range. Doors have also a Controller to open and close doors.
